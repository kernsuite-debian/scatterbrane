ScatterBrane
============

A python package for simulating realistically scattered images. 

scatterbrane allows for anisotropic scattering kernels as well as time variability studies.  For a 
lightweight version try `SlimScat <https://github.com/krosenfeld/slimscat>`_.

The package is composed of two classes.  A :class:`Brane` is used to simulate the scattering while
a :class:`Target` can be used to calculate complex visibilities and closure phases.  We have also 
included some helpful functions in the ``utiilties`` module.

.. note::

    This is a pre-release of scatterbrane.  If you have a problem please submit a pull request on the git repository.

Installation
------------
Download the latest version from the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/krosenfeld/scatterbrane>`_
, change to the main directory and run:

.. code-block:: bash

    python setup.py install

You will need working installations of `numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_, `scipy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_, and `astropy <http://www.astropy.org/>`_.  You can test your installation using the provided :doc:`examples <user/examples>` which also require `palettable <https://jiffyclub.github.io/palettable/>`_.
